================================================================

Narrative started as an internal tool. 

Narrative features:

1. **Writing Tests as Stories** - what's new section so users can learn about recent developments, release notes for nitty-gritty details, user guides to dive in and instructional videos,
2. **Running Tests**, so you can manage help the same way you manage your projects. This one is <{page name="principles" book="shade"}>important<{/page}>,
3. **Documentation from Stories** .
4. **Getting more Insight from Stories** - You can set specific expectations when you run tests from stories to learn more about behaviour of your API (access and performance stats).



These are just the features that we are starting with. Expect more theme configurability and more integrations in the future.
